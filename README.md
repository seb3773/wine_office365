This is a Microsoft Office 365 (2019) installer for linux, with the help of wine :)  
Only Word/Excel/Powerpoint in this version.  
en, fr, de & ru languages.
No licence provided of course, you must connect to your account to use your own licence of the product.  
The installer was designed for q4os trinity, but should work on any recent debian based distro (maybe with some adjustements to the .desktop files).

Instructions:
- clone the repository, an cd to the wine_office365 folder
- set install_office.sh executable: sudo chmod +x ./install_office.sh
- launch the installer: ./install_office.sh

Enjoy.
